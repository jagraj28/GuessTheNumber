# GuessTheNumber
Short game designed for a user to guess a random number within 5 attempts. The game helps the user by telling them whether their guess is too high or too low and prompts them to get closer to the answer. 
The game has also been coded so that the user doesn't crash the program when they input a non integer value as a guess using the try and except function.
